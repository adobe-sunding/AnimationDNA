**Animation DNA** is an example project for **Maya > Arnold > Nuke pipeline** which could be used as template for any full CG task â€” from a single shot to a whole 3D animation feature film. 
In other words, **Animation DNA is out of the box pipeline** for animation studio (or for a single person).  **Animation DNA** is a starting point which defines main and most important pipeline actions and could be easily refined according to requirements of a particular project.
